This folder in our repository is dedicated to showcasing examples of conditional statements (if, else, elif) and loops (for, while) in Python. These scripts demonstrate the basics of controlling flow and iterating over sequences, providing a foundation for effective programming in Python.

Conditionals: Quick examples on making decisions in your code.
Loops: Efficiently iterate through data or execute tasks repetitively.
Explore these examples to enhance your understanding of Python's control structures.
